# Position-and-orientation-determination-of-anisotropic-nanoparticles-in-assembly
This repository contains the codes I wrote for my masters thesis at EMAT (University of Antwerp). This toolbox will allow for the determination of the positions and orientations of anisotropic nanoparticles in assemblies from 3D tomographs.
NOTE: Matlab version 2021 used, TOMOHAWK code from EMAT is required for some features.
